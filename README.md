# Hydroperiod-Calculator

The Hydroperiod is determined by processing a series of water masks estimated for dates within the period between the start and end dates of the hydroperiod. This computation involves applying a designated interpolation method: when assessing two dates separated by n days, the presence of water is examined. If a pixel is submerged on both dates, it is assumed to be inundated for the full n days; otherwise, it is considered inundated for n/2 days. The cumulative count of inundation days is subsequently calculated by aggregating the water masks throughout the specified period.
